Stock Data Pipeline
This repository contains a Python-based stock data pipeline that retrieves, processes, and analyzes stock market data. The pipeline is designed to automate the acquisition of stock data from an external source, store it in a database, process the data to derive insights, and perform analytics tasks.

Features:
Data Acquisition: Fetches the latest stock market data from an external API (e.g., Alpha Vantage) using Python scripts.
Data Storage: Stores the acquired stock data in a SQLite database for efficient data retrieval and management.
Data Processing: Processes the raw stock data to perform various transformations, calculations, and analytics.
Automated Workflow: Utilizes cron jobs to schedule the execution of data acquisition and processing tasks at regular intervals. (TBD)

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Requests library for HTTP requests
SQLite database for data storage
Cron for task scheduling (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)
